# Toph
## What is it?
* Final project for ECE-UY 4144 Intro to Embedded Systems Design.
* A modular solution to wall sensing

## How?
* Miniflex contains the physical modules used in the Toph system.
* Toph is written in C using minimal Arduino-specific syntax and macros.
* Toph is extendable.  New modules can be added with a single line of code.

## Why?
* An exercise in embedded design, from hardware to software.
